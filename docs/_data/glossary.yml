brain: "The eventual output of RL; a trained AI policy that can be queried for a (theoretically optimal) output based on a provided input."

inkling: "The programming language used on the bonsai platform for training brains. It is used to define what the AI should learn and its training regimen."

traditional_model: "A simulation model without any RL components."

rl_ready_model: "A simulation model that has the components necessary to be used as the training environment for an AI algorithm."

episode: "A single simulation run, from start to finish; used in the context of training."

configuration: "A set of variables that define a scenario or starting condition for each episode."

observation: "A set of variables that describe the environment at a given point in time. This is the input to the AI algorithm."

state: "For the purpose of this guide, synonymous with Observation."

action: "A set of variables that the AI algorithm has control over in the environment. This is the output of the AI algorithm."

terminal_condition: "A (boolean) flag or indicator for when to end an episode, allowing another to begin."

iteration: "The process of taking an observation from the simulation, using it to query the AI algorithm (the brain) for an action and applying the action."

iteration_trigger: "An event inside the simulation model that pauses the simulation model and initiates an iteration, after which the simulation model resumes."

bonsai_library: "An AnyLogic plugin/add-on library giving access to the Bonsai Connector object."

bonsai_connector: "An object part of AnyLogic's Bonsai Library which is necessary to be added to your top-level agent for communicating with the Bonsai platform during locally hosted training."

locally_hosted_training: "Performing RL training with the simulation model hosted on your local machine."

uploaded_training: "Performing RL training with the simulation model uploaded to Microsoft Azure, allowing training to be scaled."

assessment: "The act of evaluating a brainâ€™s performance across a number of episodes."

playback: "A feature in the Bonsai Connector, allowing connection to an exported brain for assessment purposes."

platform: "The environment hosting the reinforcement learning algorithms; in this case, Bonsai."
